1) Dataset Classification:(Start Schema design)
Dim_Customer → Customer table
Dim_Shipping → Shipping table
Fact_Order → Order table
=========================================================================
2)Anticipated Dataset needs:
Dim_Customer (Customer Table):
------------
Purpose: Master record of customer information for reporting and analysis.
Proposed Fields & Rules:

Field	                Type	Rules
-------------------------------------
Customer_ID (PK)	    INT	    Unique, not null,numeric
First	                VARCHAR	Only alphabetic chars,spaces,- or dots 
Last	                VARCHAR	Only alphabetic chars,spaces,- or dots 
Age	                    INT  	Between be a range(0-120)
Country	                VARCHAR	Must have a standardized list of countries

Quality Enhancements Needed:
---------------------------
Must have unique Customer_ID,so remove duplicates.
Standardize name case(e.g., "jonny" → "Jonny").
Replace/fix or remove invalid characters in names (S@sda, A^^jay).
Fixed country names (no variations like "US", "USA", "United States").

Fact_Order (Order Table):
----------
Purpose: Stores transactional sales events.
Proposed Fields & Rules:

Field	               Type	     Rules
Order_ID (PK)	       INT	     Unique, not null,numeric
Item	               VARCHAR	 Descriptive text for the product/service
Amount	               DECIMAL	 Must be non negative
Customer_ID (FK)	   INT	     Must exist in Dim_Customer

Quality Enhancements Needed:
---------------------------
Must have unique Order_ID,so remove duplicates.
Ensure all Customer_ID values exist in Customer table.
Check if  Amount is positive.

Dim_Shipping (Shipping Table):
------------
Purpose: Tracks order delivery statuses.
Proposed Fields & Rules:

Field	               Type	     Rules
Shipping_ID (PK)	   INT	     Unique, not null
Status	               VARCHAR	 Must be one of: Pending, Delivered
Customer_ID (FK)	   INT	     Must be in Dim_Customer

Quality Enhancements Needed:
---------------------------
Remove duplicate Shipping_ID.
Validate that Status present.
Ensure all Customer_ID values exist in Dim_Customer table.
===============================================================================
3)Benefits of the Proposed Model:
------------------------------
Cleans, standardizes dataset that's ready for reporting
Removes orphaned and duplicate records
Creates well-maintained business rules
Scalable design for future data sources
